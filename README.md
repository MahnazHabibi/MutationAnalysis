# MutationAnalysis
A new machine learning method for cancer mutation analysis.

Descripotion:

This repository contains the data and MATLAB code for the "A new machine learning method for cancer mutation analysis":

Data sets:

File "Disease_Cases.mat" is the MATLAB .mat file contains the list of 15 diseases which are analyzed and the list of their cases.

File "Breast_Genes_Cases.mat" is the MATLAB .mat file contains the list of 573 mutated cancer genes related to breast cancer and the list of their cases.

To find feature matrix for each new list of mutated cancer genes and run machine learning algorithms follow the "Read_me.txt" steps.
